# Compiler 

- A compiler is a special program that runs on a computer and converts high-level machine instructions into machine code that the computer can understand and execute.

### Why do we use a Compiler

- A computer cannot understand human readable code.
- It should be converted to machine understandable format so that the computer can understand and execute the instructions.
- SO, the Compiler converts into machine code making the code ready for execution.

### Why do we need a Compiler

1. **Error Detection** - detects errors during compilation
2. **Code Optimization** - makes code run faster and efficiently.
3. **Translation** - converts high-level code to machine code.
4. **Portability** - same code can be run on different machines.
5. **Abstraction** - focuses on code logic, rather than hardware details.
